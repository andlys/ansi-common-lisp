# Code scratches from Paul Graham's book 'ANSI Common Lisp'

Currently, code is present to chapter 6.

Here are pieces of code which I typed manually myself
in order to have some fun with Lisp. There are also 
exercises (from the end of each chapter) written by me. These are certainly
not the best practices. Nonetheless they seem to work fine.
Note that some pieces of code from the book can be absent here.
